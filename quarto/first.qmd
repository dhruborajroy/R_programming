## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

::: callout-caution
Code that is excluded from the final doc
:::

```{r echo =TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,label=fig-starwars, fig.cap="Relationship between height and mass of starwars characters"}
library(tidyverse)
starwars %>% 
  filter(mass<100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mass,height))+
  geom_point(size=3,alpha=0.5,aes(color=gender))+
  geom_smooth()+theme_bw()
```
